"With the new material from our upcoming album "Beholder" we feel that our sound has begun to really mature. Working alongside Buster Odeholm (Humanity's Last Breath, Vildhjarta) for mixing and mastering, Bryce Butler (ex-The Faceless) for drums, and occasionally Calle Thomer (Vildhjarta, Humanity's Last Breath) for co-writing and feedback has inspired us to push ourselves to bring our own vision of this style of music to life"
