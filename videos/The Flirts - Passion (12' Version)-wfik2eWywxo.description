The Flirts - Passion (1982)

The Flirts were a female trio from New York City who had several dance hits and music videos on MTV in the early eighties when the channel was still in its infancy. The group was created and masterminded by American producer, Bobby Orlando aka 'Bobby O', an artist in his own right. The trio - initially Andrea, Holly and Rebecca - are best known for quirky and/or sensual New Wave, Hi-NRG and Dance-pop tunes, one of which was their 1982 hit "Jukebox (Don't Put Another Dime)" from their debut album 10Â¢ a Dance. The single received heavy airplay on MTV and appeared on several 80's new wave compilation albums including the Valley Girl film soundtrack.
After the moderate success of "Jukebox (Don't Put Another Dime)", the single "Passion", taken from the same album as "Jukebox", began to receive some attention in dance clubs. Other singles followed but didn't match the success of the previous two hits. The Flirts also went through numerous lineup changes; with almost every album release, some girls left the group while others stayed.
The Flirts' biggest chart success in America was with "You & Me", which hit number one on the Hot Dance Club Play chart in 1985, helped along by an early Shep Pettibone club mix. Another of their popular dance tracks was "Oriental Boy"; in the song, the singer is in love with an Asian man who ultimately leaves her despite her pleading.
