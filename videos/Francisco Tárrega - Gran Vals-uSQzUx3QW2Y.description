Francisco de Asís Tárrega y Eixea (21 November 1852 - 15 December 1909) was an influential Spanish composer and guitarist of the Romantic period.

He is the composer of what has been claimed to be "probably the world's most heard tune": the Nokia ringtone, Nokia tune, or simply Nokia, also used in advertising spots, is based on Tárrega's Gran Vals.
